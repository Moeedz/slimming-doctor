This provides him a unique expertise in creating bespoke weight loss programs to work around your lifestyle. At the Slimming Doctor, our goal is to help you lose weight affectively and in a safe way.

            "answer": "<p>Your doctor will assess your current eating habits and lifestyle, and provide a personalised meal plan which will be suited to your requirements. At Slimming Doctor, we do not support crash dieting or ‘fad’ diet culture. Overwhelming medical evidence suggests that not only they do not work for sustainable weight loss, but can cause serious harm to your physical and mental health, including an eating disorder! Our aim is to help you achieve sustainable weight loss whilst avoiding harmful behaviours.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>Weight-loss medication should never be taken without a doctor’s consultation and never be purchased online. You should never get them from an unreliable source. Our medication works by curbing your hunger instead of a drastic reduction in your appetite. It only acts as an aid through your weight loss journey. They only work when coupled with the right balance of calories in your diet and exercise; all of which our doctor will guide you through.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>The short answer is ‘yes’. This medication is by no means a miracle cure to lose weight. Exercising along with the healthy eating habits would need to be followed to achieve optimum results.</p>"

This is mainly because they are abused and are taken <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">without </span>a doctor’s consultation. At our clinic you will be given a <strong>bespoke diet plan </strong>along with your medication. You will also be <strong>monitored </strong>throughout your weight loss journey. Like any medication there are side-effects, however our doctor will explain these during your very first consultation. Side-effects are also listed in the patient information leaflet which our doctor will provide.</p>"
