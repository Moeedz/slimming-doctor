I have extensive experience working as a weight loss specialist doctor.</p><p>My interest in weight loss stems from my own struggles losing and regaining weight throughout my life. So, I understand how difficult and demoralising it is when you are trying your best and it just is not working, or when it works it is for short-term and all the weight comes back, plus some more!</p><p>I am passionate about helping and guiding my patients through their weight loss journey, whilst reversing and preventing chronic diseases associated with obesity. On a personal level, I find it to be very rewarding and satisfying when I see my patients regain control over their lives– whether that means that are becoming more active with their children or regaining the confidence back. What ever your goal, I can help.</p><p>I am also a psychiatrist in eating disorders- what this means is that I help people with a range of eating problems some of which is caused and perpetuated by the dangerous dietary advise given to them. I strongly feel that this gives me a very unique insight into the psychology of difficult relationship with food which often leads to obesity. </p><p>At Slimming Doctor, we believe that to successfully lose weight and to keep it off you must address how your body works (as in physiology) and how your mind works (psychology). My aim is to navigate my patients into achieving sustainable weight loss in a<br/>safe and effective way.</p><p>So, If you are interested in booking a Free consultation with myself and see how me and my team can help you, just hit the button</p>",
